# Filename:	Makefile
# Purpose:	This makefile is used (recursively) to build all
#		components of the Virtual AGC project, for Linux and
#		similar targets.
# Mods:		10/22/03 RSB	Wrote.
#		11/02/03 RSB	Added Luminary131.
#		11/13/03 RSB	Added Colossus249.
#		05/01/04 RSB	Now provide yadsky also as yaDSKY, after install.
#		05/06/04 RSB	Now installs *.ini.
#		05/13/04 RSB	Now excludes *CVS* and *snprj* from the tarball.
#		05/14/04 RSB	Added PREFIX (for setting the installation
#				directory.
#		05/18/04 RSB	Added a datestamp to the dev. snapshot.
#		05/31/04 RSB	Move snapshot to ftp.
#		07/03/04 RSB	Added the Validation directory.
#		07/14/04 RSB	Added ControlPulseSim
#		08/09/04 RSB	Eliminate the contents of autom4te.cache/* when 
#				building a snapshot.  (These contents mess up
#				'configure' on some systems.)
#		08/10/04 RSB	Added the Sim* shell scripts to the installable
#				files.
#		08/12/04 RSB	Added NVER.  Went to v0.90.
#		08/13/04 RSB	Went to v20040813
#		08/24/04 RSB	Exclude ephemeris data from development snapshot,
#				but make a second file for it.
#		08/25/04 RSB	Added yaIMU.
# 		08/29/04 RSB	Made snapshot-ephemeris a separate target from
#				snapshot.
#		08/30/04 RSB	Moved the directory for snapshots from ftp space
#				into http space.
#		09/02/04 RSB	Changed yaIMU to yaUniverse.
#		01/10/05 RSB	Added binLEMAP.
#		04/30/05 RSB	Added CFLAGS
#		05/08/05 RSB	Added a 'snapshot' target.
#		05/14/05 RSB	Made some Mac OS X related changes for 'snapshot'.
#		05/28/05 RSB	Added yaDEDA.
#		06/02/05 RSB	Added yaAGS.
#		06/14/05 RSB	Updated the version code.
#		06/19/05 RSB	Added the NOGUI=yes command-line option.
#		07/06/05 RSB	Added Artemis072
#		07/28/05 RSB	Oops!  Had multiple "snapshot" targets.
#		08/04/05 RSB	Added the CURSES variable.
#		08/06/05 RSB	Now detect build-platform type using the
#				OSTYPE environment variable, which seems to
#				be reasonably consistent in distinguishing
#				at least the following cases:
#					OSTYPE=linux	
#					OSTYPE=darwin	(MacOS X)
#					OSTYPE=msys	(Msys on Win32)
#					OSTYPE=cygwin	(CygWin on Win32)
#				All of these cases use the "linux" Makefile,
#				but with very minor flourishes, except the
#				Msys case, which uses Makefile.Win32 instead.
#		01/09/06 RSB	Removed the prefix '-' from the lines that
#				build Artemis072.
#		02/26/06 RSB	Now creates a script called VirtualAgcUninstall
#				during installation.
#		03/05/07 RSB	Changed the default compiler flags to include
#				"-DALLOW_BSUB".  This allows yaAGC and friends
#				to pass instructions in the BSUB register upon
#				exiting from an interrupt-service routine.
#		03/01/09 RSB	Updated the version code.
#		03/05/09 RSB	Now builds VirtualAGC.
#		03/06/09 RSB	There are new targets: 'default' is the same 
#				as 'all'.  'all-archs' is like 'all', except 
# 				that 'all' builds only for the native platform
#				while 'all-archs' is used when running under
#				Linux to create the Linux, Win32, and Mac
#				stuff.
#		03/11/09 RSB	yaTelemetry added.
#		03/12/09 RSB	yaDSKY replaced by yaDSKY2, by default..
#		03/13/09 RSB	Added provisions for replacing yaDEDA by yaDEDA2.
#		03/16/09 RSB	"make clean" would fail if ./configure hadn't
#				been performed due to the fact that it isn't
#				needed when yaDSKY and yaDEDA aren't built.
#		03/19/09 RSB	Will now *try* to build yaDSKY/yaDEDA even if
#				yaDSKY2/yaDEDA2 are selected, and vice-versa.
#				However, failure won't a fatal error.  If find
#				it useful for both to be available for 
#				debugging.
#		03/28/09 RSB	Merged in yaACA3.
#		04/14/09 RSB	Made some mods to help this build in Solaris.
#		04/25/09 RSB	Fixed dev snapshots to exclude .svn directories.
#		04/26/09 RSB	Backed out all of the stuff that relies on
#				Makefile.Win32, and most stuff for OS 
#				auto-detection.  Removed the "os" target.
#				Removed the "install" target.
#		05/02/09 RSB	Added DEV_STATIC to change builds of binary
#				installers so that the wxWidgets-based programs
#				are dynamic-linked rather than static-linked.
#				However, it doesn't appear to me as though it
#				would change the size of the binary packages
#				in any significant way to use the dynamic
#				libraries, so I don't bother to do it.
#				Updated to make work with FreeBSD (PC-BSD 7.1).
#				Adjusted for SOLARIS.
#		05/23/09 RSB	Added Comanche055 to the normal build sequence.
#		06/07/09 RSB	Added Luminary099 to the normal build sequence.
#		06/29/09 RSB	Added the 'listings' target.
#		08/02/09 RSB	Now that I got rid of libreadline on the Win32
#				productin build (yesterday), I'm beginning to
#				experience readline-related problems (but 
#				different ones) on Linux.  I'm completely
#				disabling readline for all platforms for now,
#				until these problems can be fixed.
#		09/08/09 JL	Commented out Artemis072 from main build. 
#		01/30/10 RSB	Added yaASM.
#		02/16/10 RSB	Adjustments associated with getting
#				Artemis072 into the installers.
#
# The build box is always Linux for cross-compiles.  For native compiles:
#	Use "make MACOSX=yes" for Mac OS X.
#	Use "make SOLARIS=yes" for Solaris.
#	Use "make WIN32=yes" for Windows.
#	Use "gmake FREEBSD=yes" for FreeBSD.
#	Use "make" for Linux.

# NVER is the overall version code for the release.

# DON'T CHANGE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH *********************************
# This switch determines whether or not wxWidgets programs are built
# statically linked or dynamically linked for the binary installers
# associated with the development snapshots.  It has nothing whatever
# to do with normal builds by normal users.  Uncommented, they're
# static.  Commented, they're dynamic.  And yes, DEV_STATIC *should*
# be repeated.  I haven't fully worked out yet how to get the dynamic
# libraries into the installers, however, so don't use them!

# Comment out the following line(s) to use yaDSKY rather than yaDSKY2 and/or 
# yaDEDA by yaDEDA2.  yaDSKY/yaDEDA have been replaced by yaDSKY2/yaDEDA2 
# principally because yaDSKY/yaDEDA are gtk+ based while yaDSKY2/yaDEDA2
# are wxWidgets based.  At present, I consider wxWidgets superior to gtk+
# (in this particular application) because: a) I can get it to work on a 
# wider range of platforms; b) I can link statically to it rather than 
# being forced to use shared libraries.  yaDSKY2/yaDEDA2 are drop-in 
# identically-featured replacements for yaDSKY/yaDEDA, except that certain
# options useful only in debugging or *only* for GTK+ aren't implemented.
# These include the --test-downlink, --relative-pixmaps, and --show-packets
# switches.  yaTelemetry has already been made available (and is the preferred
# method) to provide the --test-downlink functionaly.  And, of course, the 
# original versions of yaDSKY/yaDEDA are still available even though not 
# compiled by default.
