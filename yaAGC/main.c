  Filename:	main.c
  Purpose:	A top-level program for running the AGC simulation\
  		in a PC environment.
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.
  Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
  Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
  Mods:		04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
		10/20/03 RSB.	Added a fake times() function for WIN32.
		11/26/03 RSB.	Added the actual machine-cycle timing.
				(Previously, it just ran as fast as it could.
				Now, the machine cycles are about 11.7 us.)
				Began adding a primitive debugging capability.
		11/28/03 RSB.	Added a bunch of new debugging stuff.
		11/30/03 RSB.	Added interactively helting AGC-program
				execution (whether in --debug mode or not).
		05/01/04 RSB	--debug-dsky mode was fixed by adding the
				--debug mode.  Too bad I didn't test it.
		05/04/04 RSB	The disassembly of AD was reading ADD.
		05/05/04 RSB	In the debugger, added S and N as synonyms for
				STEP and NEXT.
		05/06/04 RSB	Now displays error for non-existent *.ini file.
				Now does a little bit to find *.bin and *.ini
				in the installation directory if not in the
				current directory.
		05/08/04 RSB	The disassembler now shows the opcodes for
				the "implied address codes" --- i.e., things
				like SQUARE in place of "MP A".  Also, the
				instructions are now shown as indexed.
				Corrected the starting cycle count used for
				timing in case the --resume file is used.
				The timing used in debugging was completely
				wrong, as it did not account for the time
				the debugger was paused for user input.
		05/09/04 RSB	Added the GETOCT command to the disassembler.
		05/10/04 RSB	Fixed bank-editing in --debug mode, hopefully.
		05/12/04 RSB	Added backtrace stuff.
		05/13/04 RSB	Corrected disassembly of superbanks.  Fixed
				the --debug command EDIT, which I apparently
				broke yesterday.
		05/14/04 RSB	Added interrupt-related --debug commands.
		05/17/04 RSB	Added INTERRUPTS ENABLE and INTERRUPTS DISABLE.
				... Changed to MASKOFF 0 and MASKON 0.
				Also changed INTERRUPT to INTON, added INTOFF,
				MASKON, and MASKOFF.
		05/31/04 RSB	Debugger now shows actual bank numbers in addition
				to just the contents of the EB and FB registers.
				Also, the debugger now correctly decodes overflow
				and shows the accumulator as a 16-bit register.
				For the DUMP, EDIT, DELETE, and BREAK debugger
				commands, erasable and fixed bank numbers are
				now taken from the EB or FB register if omitted.
				Socket info now shown in the debugger.
		06/02/04 RSB	In --debug, BREAK and DELETE didn't work
				properly in and around superbanks (nor did
				the breakpoint itself work).
		06/08/04 RSB	Added primitive watchpoints.
		06/11/04 RSB	Altered the sys/times.h include in WIN32.
		06/30/04 RSB	Implemented PATTERN.
		07/01/04 RSB	Enlarged the number of allowed breakpoints
				dramatically (32 -> 256), in order to
				account for the possibility of trapping
				upon executing a lot of different instruction
				types at once.  Also, accounted for a certain
				level of testing of FROMFILEs.  Fixed it so
				that COREDUMP and FROMFILE don't automatically
				convert filenames to upper case.  Added a
				comment command ("#") to --debug mode.
		07/12/04 RSB	Q is now 16 bits.
		07/15/04 RSB	Added the LOG command to --debug mode.
		07/15/04 RSB	Data now aligned at bit 0 rather than bit 1.
		07/19/04 RSB	Changed the WIN32 version of times from clock()
				to GetTickCount().  Added the --interlace
				option.  Adjusted the lengths of the debugging status
				messages to fit on the crippled Win32 command lines.
		07/20/04 RSB	Oops!  Apparently forgot to implement --port=N.
		08/01/04 RSB	The enormous CPU usage in --debug whilst waiting
				for a keystroke has been cut to almost nothing.
		08/09/04 RSB	Adapted to use a threaded model for keyboard input,
				so as to avoid the problem if getc() blocking on
				Win32.
		08/10/04 RSB	Split help screen from --debug mode into separate
				help topics.  This is partially just from good
				sense, but also partially because when I just
				printf the whole menu, it's truncated after some
				(presumably fixed) number of characters, and I don't
				feel like figuring out that problem.
		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
		05/31/05 RSB	Added --debug-deda mode.
		07/05/05 RSB	Added autosave and autorestore of erasable memory.
		07/13/05 RSB	Fixed a possible issue of using too much CPU time
				in Win32.
		07/27/05 JMS    Added --symbtab argument and basic support for
                                symbolic debugging. New/exiting commands which
				can take symbols as arguments: break, print,
				whatis, list.
		07/28/05 JMS    Added "list" debug command which lists source. Also
		                if a symbol table is loaded, the source line is
				displayed when stepping through the code instead
				of a disassembly.
		07/30/05 JMS    Added "files" command to list source files. Some
                                better printing of breakpoints.
		08/17/05 RSB	Hopefully now correctly shows instruction when
				taken from B reg.
		08/20/05 RSB	The ability to delete breakpoints at a numerical
				address had been broken by the symbolic debugging.
				Now fixed.  However, fixed memory is somehow being
				overwritten; to debug that condition, I've added
				all the stuff associated with DEBUG_OVERWRITE_FIXED.
		08/21/05 RSB	Corrected calculation of fixed banks in
				GetFromZ.  Auto-detect "TC 0" when A=0 as an
				infinite loop.
		08/22/05 RSB	"unsigned long long" replaced by uint64_t.
		08/23/05 RSB	Added the debugging command "WATCH A V".
		10/13/05 RSB	Added "VIEW A".  Fixed "WATCH A" so that it could
				accept variable names in addition to numerical
				addresses.
		10/29/05 RSB	For VIEW, initialize value to an illegal
				number, so that the value is always displayed
				at least once.
		04/11/07 RSB	At some point (exactly when isn't clear), I messed
				up the calculation of the timing, which is supposed
				to be 64 bits, so that intermediate results were
				32 bit.  This caused the timing to fail after 4
				minutes of operation, because of integer wraparound.
				The symptom was that the AGC started running very
				fast, the CPU utilization shot up to the maximum,
				and LM_Simulator failed.  The 20060110 dev snapshot
				worked properly, for reasons I fail to understand.
		02/03/08 OH	Start adding GDB/MI interface
		08/23/08 OH Only support GDB/MI and not proprietary debugging
