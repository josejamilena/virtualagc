# Filename:	Makefile.Win32
# Purpose:	Makefile for the AGC simulation,
# Mods:		04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
#		04/21/03 RSB.	Added libyaAGC.a.
#		06/11/04 RSB	Added CheckDec.c, rfopen.o, backtrace.o
#				random.o.
#		07/19/04 RSB	Added the -lkernel32 switch for yaAGC.exe.
#		08/10/04 RSB	Added threading for yaAGC.exe.
#		08/18/04 RSB	Accounted for SocketAPI.
#		04/30/05 RSB	Added CFLAGS
#		07/12/05 RSB	Added WinAGC.exe
#		07/28/05 RSB	Added symbol_table.c.  Note that in Win32,
#				this necessitates also adding GNU regex.
#		2005-08-14 RSB	Compensated for funky naming rules now in the
#				pthreads library.
#		2007-03-05 RSB	Changed the default compiler flags to include
#				"-DALLOW_BSUB".  This allows yaAGC and friends
#				to pass instructions in the BSUB register upon
#				exiting from an interrupt-service routine.
